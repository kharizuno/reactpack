## Getting Started

Those are reactjs setup for my project.
You can find out the order install from file app-setup.txt

### `npm install`

Install node modules first

### `npm run dev:staging`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
